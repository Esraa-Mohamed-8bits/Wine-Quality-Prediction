🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine using machine learning techniques based on its physicochemical attributes.

By analyzing factors such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH value, the model learns patterns that influence wine quality ratings.
The project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, preprocessing, and supervised machine learning.
